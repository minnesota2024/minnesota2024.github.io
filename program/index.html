            <div class="mid" id="speaker1" style="display: none;">
              Modern society is witnessing the emergence of complex networked systems driven by exchanges of information among their elements, such as robotic swarms, autonomous systems, social networks, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) architectures. In these applications, data is collected from heterogeneous sources and is generally dispersed across geographic locations. In this context, it is imperative to design learning algorithms that are better suited to the reality of networked units. New methodologies are necessary to account for “coupling” among “intelligent” agents in a manner that respects privacy, enables multi-tasking, promotes fairness, and is robust to malicious interference. Motivated by these considerations, we provide an overview of algorithms for learning and decision-making that exploit important characteristics of social interactions over graphs. We refer to the framework as Social Machine Learning: it handles heterogeneity in data more gracefully, learns with performance guarantees, is more resilient to adversarial attacks, and promotes explainable and fair learning. The framework exploits three properties that are normally missing from existing learning approaches: diversity, decentralization, and group dynamics. </div>

            <div class="mid" id="speaker2" style="display: none;">
             This talk offers a retrospective view of mobile wireless technology spanning the past four decades. The wireless research community generated many ideas, but only a few have been incorporated into mobile standards, and even less have been enabled in deployed networks. This talk outlines some of the complex tradeoffs that determined what technologies got in and what did not.
Finally, some thoughts on NextG. </div>

            <div class="mid" id="speaker3" style="display: none;">
             An active and intelligent power distribution grid is emerging due to the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, heat pumps, and other power electronics. In the first part of the talk, I will describe an early work of Giannakis and collaborators that formulates DER management as a nonconvex optimal power flow problem and solves it using semidefinite relaxation in a distributed manner. I will then present our own work that attempts to explain why such methods work well empirically even though the problem is NP-hard in theory.  Most grid control and optimization algorithms assume network models are known which is often not the case in practice. In the second part of the talk, I will describe a recent work of Giannakis and collaborators that proposes an active probing approach for learning network topology and line parameters.  I will then describe a method to learn the network model of an unbalanced three-phase radial network from voltage and current measurements at a subset of the nodes, by reversing Kron reduction.  Finally I will present the design and deployment of a large-scale EV charging system and an open-source research facility built upon it. </div>

           Steven Low is the F. J. Gilloon Professor of the Department of Computing & Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Electrical Engineering at Caltech.  Before that, he was with AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, and the University of Melbourne, Australia.  He has held honorary/chaired professorships in Australia, China and Taiwan. He was a co-recipient of IEEE best paper awards, an awardee of the IEEE INFOCOM Achievement Award and the ACM SIGMETRICS Test of Time Award, and is a Fellow of IEEE, ACM, and CSEE. He was known for work on Internet congestion control and semidefinite relaxation of optimal power flow problems in smart grid. His research on networks has been accelerating more than 1TB of Internet traffic every second since 2014. His research on smart grid has created one of the largest EV charging networks in the US and delivered 130K miles/day in 2022. He received his B.S. from Cornell and PhD from Berkeley, both in EE. </div>

Randall Berry joined Northwestern University in 2000, where he is currently the Chair and John A. Dever Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His research interests span topics in wireless communications, computer networking, network economics, and information theory. Dr. Berry received the M.S. and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996 and 2000, respectively, where he was part of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. His undergraduate education was at the University of Missouri-Rolla, where he received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1993. In 1998 he was on the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Advanced Networks Group. Dr. Berry is the recipient of a 2003 CAREER award from the National Science Foundation. He has also received the Best Teacher award for the 2001/2002 academic year from the ECE Department at Northwestern University and was nominated to 2012 Northwestern University Associated Student Government Faculty Honor Roll. He is an IEEE Communications Society Distinguished Lecturer for 2013-14. He has served as an Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications from 2006 to 2009, and an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory from 2009 to 2011, in the area of communication networks. He has also been a guest editor for the IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing special issue on Dynamic Spectrum Access and the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory special issue on Relaying and Cooperation. He has served on the program and organizing committees of numerous conferences including serving as the co-chair of the 2012 IEEE Communication Theory Workshop and a technical co-chair of 2010 IEEE ICC Wireless Networking Symposium. He was elevated to IEEE Fellow in the class of 2014 for contributions to resource allocation and interference management in wireless networks.
